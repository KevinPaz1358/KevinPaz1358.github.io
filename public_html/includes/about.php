               <li> <a class="helpHeadings2">Purpose<br></a>
                 Jarvis Smart Assitant was created to improve upon the existing digital personal assistants by allowing for direct integration with other software, to allow for direct access or information contained within other applications.
                 
               <li> <a class="helpHeadings2">Functions<br></a>
                 Currently the smart assistant has the ability to recognize and isolate audio commands, so that only authorized users can interact with it. By having this built in authorization, the smart assistant can recognize and accept commands from multiple users on the same device, thus allowing for secure access to sensitive documents, such as buisness records, audio recordings and other files.
                 
               <li> <a class="helpHeadings2">App Integration<br></a>
                 As of the current version of the smart assistant, the officially supported integrated applications include all of the Google productivity suite (Google Docs, Sheets, Gmail, Drive, etc.) with more applications becoming available with official support in the near future.
               <li> <a class="helpHeadings2">Upcoming Features<br></a>
                 Some of the upcoming features include playback control for multiple audio streaming applications, alarm/calendar integration, and desktop and  smart home device versions of the application.
